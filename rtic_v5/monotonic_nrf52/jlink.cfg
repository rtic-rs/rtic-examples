# Configure a flash bank
#
# I'm not sure what exactly that does, or why it's required, but flashing
# doesn't work without it, so here we go.
#
# That "nrf51" bit in there looks wrong, but it isn't. It's the name of the
# flash driver, and for some reason, the nRF52832 is covered by the nrf51
# driver. As far as I can tell, there isn't even an nrf52 driver.
#
# As of 2018-08-13, the documentation I found on openocd.org[1] states that the
# driver's name should be "nrf5", which makes more sense. That seems to apply to
# the in-development version, however, not the currently released one (0.10.0).
